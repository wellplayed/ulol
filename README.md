# 3. Team Management and Roster Rules

## 3.1 Roster Size
Teams will be required to have six eligible players on its roster at all times.  There are no restrictions on position or designation of starter or substitute.

## 3.2 Roster Listing
The Active Roster will be displayed on an official competition website, to be shared publicly with teams. The Active Roster on that website will be updated upon proper filing of documentation. Once an acquisition is confirmed, the acquisition will be placed on the website. The Active Roster on that website will be considered the most up to date roster that could be applied within a reasonable time. Roster eligibility is still at the discretion of Campus Series officials.

## 3.3 Team Manager
Each team must also designate a Team Manager, who may be but does not need to be a player on the Active Roster. The Manager will be the primary point of contact for all Campus Series officials, and will also be the signatory authority for any documents which cause changes to the Active Roster, as outlined in [Section 3.3](#33-team-manager) and [3.4](#34-manager-overrule). The manager must be identified before the start of the Series, and a successor must be immediately identified if the Manager leaves the team (for any reason). The manager must be fully eligible in accordance with Sections [1.2.3](#123-riot-disciplinary-status) and [1.3](#13-no-riot-employees).

## 3.4 Manager Overrule
At the sole discretion of Campus Series officials, team managers may be overruled or replaced due to negligence, malice, or other reasonable suspicion of malfeasance.

## 3.5 Substitutes
Teams may freely play any 5 players from their roster at any time without any notification or approval process.

## 3.6 Acquisitions
A team may only acquire new players if a player is removed from their roster, per [Section 3.1](#31-roster-size).  Any new players must be fully eligible per [Section 1](#1-competition-eligibility).  If a team wishes to acquire a new player, that acquisition must be declared to a Campus Series official more than 3 full days before the game where the player would be utilized (e.g. if the next match is on Friday, a new player must be declared no later than Monday). Campus Series officials reserve the right to approve or deny any such request, based upon the eligibility of the players involved and the request’s compliance with the Rules.

## 3.7 Summoner Name Restrictions
For players who qualify for the Regular Season, Summoner Names and Team Names may not contain: vulgarities or obscenities; LoL champion derivatives or other similar character names; or derivatives of products or services that may create confusion.

## 3.8 Name Approval
All Team Tags, Team Names, and Summoner Names must be approved by Campus Series officials in advance of use in play. Unapproved name changes are not allowed under any circumstances. Campus Series officials have the ability to deny a team name if it does not reflect the standards sought by the Campus Series. A team or player will be notified by a Campus Series official if their name does not meet the standard, and the team will be allowed to change their name.  Players may not change their Summoner names on their main account during the season.

## 3.9 Sponsorships
A Campus Series team has the ability to acquire sponsors throughout the Campus Series season. Sponsorship acquisition is unrestricted. However, teams may not acquire “title sponsors,” as teams will solely be represented by their school name and a unique team logo without additional branding.

If the sponsor falls under the ensuing limited categories then the sponsorship may not be displayed by the players during the use or play of LoL, adjacent to LoL related material, the Campus Series, or any Riot-affiliated events. The Campus Series officials have the ability to update the category list at any time. The following is a nonexclusive list of limited sponsors:

 - **3.9.1** Gambling Websites:  defined as any website that aids or abets the wagering of funds on a sporting/esporting event and/or allows for the wagering of funds in casino games including poker.
 - **3.9.2** Non-“over-the-counter” drugs
 - **3.9.3** Account sharing/skin selling websites
 - **3.9.4** Firearms, handguns, or ammunition providers
 - **3.9.5** Websites displaying or related to pornographic imagery or products
 - **3.9.6** Tobacco, smoking, or vaping products


# 4. League Structure

## 4.1 Definition of Terms
**Game**: An instance of competition on the Summoner’s Rift map that is played until a winner is determined by one of the following methods, whichever occurs first:  (a) Destruction of a Nexus, (b) Team Surrender, (c) Team Forfeit, or (d) Awarded Game Victory (See [Section 6.4](#64-awarded-game-victory).

**Match**: A set of games that is played until one team wins a majority of the total games (e.g., winning two games out of three (“best of three”); winning three games out of five (“best of five”)). The winning team will either receive a win tally in a league format or advance to the next round in a bracket format.

## 4.2 Phase Details

### 4.2.1 Open Qualifier.  
This phase consists of a single elimination bracket of up to 512 teams per conference.  Teams who placed in the Top 4 of the 2015 Campus Series Conference Championships will be seeded into separate quadrants of the bracket.  All other teams will be randomly seeded.

### 4.2.2 Regular Season.
This phase consists of eight teams in a league format against opponents within their conference.  Each team will face each of their opponents twice per split, for a total of fourteen games per team.  Sides will be pre-determined and teams will start on the blue and red sides an equal number of times against each opponent (one game per side). Ranking in the league will be determined by percentage of wins. A full schedule of dates will be made available online.

### 4.2.3 Regular Season Tiebreaker.
In the event that multiple teams are tied in the standings at the conclusion of either Regular Season split (as defined as having the same winning percentage), then any teams so tied will be seeded by head-to-head record. If said teams have identical head-to-head records (as defined as each team winning 50% of games between the two teams), said teams will play one tiebreaker game to determine the final standings.

#### 4.2.3.1 Tiebreaker Schedule.  
Tiebreakers will be played following the final game of the Regular Season, but prior to the first day of the Playoffs. Tied teams will compete against each other until there is a winner.


#### 4.2.3.2 Side Choice.  Side choice is determined by coin flip for all tiebreakers.

#### 4.2.3.3 Head-to-Head Advantage. 
If three or more teams are tied, the head-to-head record of all teams against all other teams involved in the tiebreaker will be considered. If a single team owns a winning record (as defined as winning more than 50% of the games) against every other team in the tiebreaker, they are automatically granted the highest seed available in the tiebreaker, and a new tiebreaker is declared amongst the remaining teams.

#### 4.2.3.4 Tiebreaker methodology.
If no team in a tiebreaker holds a winning record against all other teams, the following structures will be used:

##### 4.2.3.4.1 Three-way tie 
A single round-robin will be played among the three teams. If this does not result in a hierarchical ranking of teams (i.e., distinct 2-0, 1-1, and 0-2 team records), then the three teams will be randomly drawn into a single-elimination bracket where one team has a bye into the finals.

##### 4.2.3.4.2 Four-way tie
The teams will be randomly drawn into a “Korean-style” or “dual” bracket, where teams play Bo1 matches throughout the tournament. The four teams will be split into two first-round matches; the winners will then face off in Game 3 while the losers face off in Game 4. The winner of Game 3 will be declared the top seed; the loser of Game 3 will face the winner of Game 4 in a contest to determine 2nd/3rd place; and the loser of Game 4 will be declared 4th place.

##### 4.2.3.4.3 Five-way tie or greater
The teams will be randomly drawn into a single elimination bracket, with teams randomly receiving byes into the semi-finals as needed.  Additional placement games for placement (e.g. 3rd place  match, 5th place match) may be required.


### 4.2.4 Conference Championships
This phase consists of a two-round, best-of-5 single elimination tournament among the top 4 teams from each conference.  Teams will be seeded based on their Regular Season record and Tiebreakers (if applicable). Side choice will begin with the higher-seeded team and alternate per game.

### 4.2.5 Campus Series Finals
This phase consists of a two-round, best-of-5 single elimination tournament among the 4 winners from each Conference Championship. Side choice for the first game of each match will be determined by coin flip, then will alternate per game.


## 4.3 Schedule

  - **4.3.1 Open Qualifier**: Nov 3 - Nov 15
  - **4.3.2 Regular Season**: Jan 11 - Feb 28
  - **4.3.3 Conference Semifinals**: Feb 29 - Mar 13

  - **4.3.6 Changes to Schedule**: Campus Series may, at its sole discretion, re-order the schedule of matches within a given day and/or change the date of a Campus Series match to a different date or otherwise modify the schedule of matches. In the event that Campus Series modifies a match schedule, Campus Series will notify all teams at the earliest convenience.
 
# 5. Match Process

## 5.1 Role of Referees
Referees are Campus Series officials who are responsible for making judgments on every match-related issue, question and situation which occurs before, during, and immediately following match play.

### 5.1.1 Referee Responsibilities.  
Referee oversight may include, but is not limited to the following:

 - **5.1.1.1** Checking the team’s lineup before a match.
 - **5.1.1.2** Announcing the beginning of the match.
 - **5.1.1.3** Ordering pause/resume during play.
 - **5.1.1.4** Issuing penalties in response to Rule violations before, during, or after the match.
 - **5.1.1.5** Confirming the end of the match and its results.

### 5.1.2 Referee Comportment
At all times, referees shall conduct themselves in a professional manner, and shall issue rulings in an impartial manner. No passion or prejudice will be shown towards any player, team, team manager, coach, owner, or other individual.

### 5.1.3 Finality of Judgment
If a referee makes an incorrect judgment, the judgment can be subject to reversal. Campus Series officials at their discretion may evaluate the decision during or after the match to determine if the proper procedure was implemented to allow for a fair decision.  If the proper procedure was not followed, Campus Series officials reserve the right to potentially invalidate the referee’s decision. Campus Series officials will always maintain final say in all decisions set forth throughout the Campus Series.

### 5.1.4 Gambling Prohibition
All rules prohibiting gambling on LoL, as found below in [Section 7.3](#73-association-with-gambling), shall apply to referees without limitation.

## 5.2 Competitive Patch & Server
Campus Series will be played on the North America live server.  As such, the current live patch will be used for all competitive play.


## 5.3 New & Reworked Champions
Champions who have not been available on the live service for more than 3 days will be automatically prohibited from use. Champions that have undergone reworks will be subject to Campus Series discretion.

Example: Champion A was released January 1, 2016, so Champion A becomes eligible to be used in all Campus Series matches on or after January 4, 2016.

Campus Series will not unlock a champion in the middle of a week of the Regular Season or round of the Playoffs.

## 5.4 Setup and Player Responsibilities for Online Matches
All players will be expected to be ready to join the game lobby at the time specified by the Campus Series officials.  Readiness includes, but is not limited to, five rostered players having completed client patching, configuration of in-game settings, and completed rune and mastery pages.

## 5.5 Schedule Adjustments
Campus Series officials, in their sole discretion, have the right to adjust the match schedule at any time to preserve the pacing of the tournament or to remedy such circumstances as may detract from the viewer experience.

## 5.6 Lateness Penalties
Teams that are not ready to play as defined [Section 5.4](#54-setup-and-player-responsibilities-for-online-matches) at their official match time are subject to lateness penalties. A team will lose one ban per 5 minutes of lateness.  A team will be subject to forfeiture if 25 minutes have elapsed since their official match time.  Intentionally delaying the lobby or game start will still subject the team to the rules set forth in this section.

## 5.7 Pause Process
Teams or players may pause the game for any reason.  After a pause, the pausing team must use /all to share the reason for the pause and the estimated time to unpause.  When a team is ready to unpause, at least one player from both teams must declare their readiness in /all chat (e.g. “ready” or “r”) before the pausing team is allowed to unpause the game.

## 5.8 Pause Allowance
Teams may pause the game for a maximum of 10 minutes over the course of a single game, or 20 minutes over the course of a best-of-three match.  Pausing beyond allowance time will be considered unfair play and penalties will be applied at the discretion of tournament officials.

## 5.9 4v5 Play
Teams are required to field a full team of five players be considered ready to start any match.  If a player disconnects from the lobby or champion select, the team is no longer ready to play, and lateness time begins.  If a player disconnects from the game, the game may continue as normal or be paused per [Section 5.8](#58-pause-allowance).

## 5.10 Player Equipment Responsibility
All players are responsible for ensuring the performance of their chosen setup, including computer hardware and peripherals, internet connection, and power.  A problem with player equipment is not an acceptable reason for lateness or pausing beyond a team’s allowance, regardless of the root cause of the problem.

## 5.11 No Spectators
Only five players per team are allowed in the game lobby.  No additional spectators are permitted for any reason.

## 5.12 No Streaming
Players are not permitted to stream their tournament matches publicly or privately on any platform or service. Players may stream personal or professional recordings of the match after the broadcast has officially completed.

## 5.13 Game Lobby Creation.
Campus Series officials will open the official game lobby and provide access to competing teams. Players will be directed by Campus Series officials to join a game lobby as soon as testing has been completed, in the following order of positions: Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support.

## 5.14 Game Setup

### 5.14.1 Start of Champion Select
Once all ten players have reported to the official game lobby, a Campus Series official will request confirmation that both teams are ready for Champion Select.  Once both teams confirm readiness, a Campus Series official will instruct the room owner to start the game.

### 5.14.2 Recording of Champion Select
Picks/bans will proceed through the client’s Tournament Draft feature. If picks/bans are completed in advance of game setup for any reason, Campus Series officials will record the official picks/bans and manually abort the game start.

### 5.14.3 Game Lobby Settings
 - **5.14.3.1 Map**: Summoner’s Rift
 - **5.14.3.2 Team Size**: 5
 - **5.14.3.3 Allow Spectators**: Lobby Only
 - **5.14.3.4 Game Type**: Tournament Draft

##5.15 Side Selection.
Sides will be pre-determined during the regular season and teams will start on the blue and red sides an equal number of times against each opponent (one game per side). In all seed-based matches (qualifiers and playoffs), the higher-ranked seed will have side selection for odd-numbered games (e.g. Games 1, 3, and 5), while the lower seed will have side selection for even-numbered games (Games 2 and 4). For example, the higher seed may choose to play game 1 on blue side, but game 3 and 5 on red side and the lower seed may choose to play game 2 on red side and game 4 on blue side. Both teams will be required to submit their final decision by 7:00pm of the night before the match is scheduled (in the time zone where the game will be played). If no decision is submitted, selection will default to blue side.


## 5.16 Champion Select Process

### 5.16.1 Tournament Draft 
Campus Series officials may choose to employ either the Tournament Draft mode feature or a manual draft (e.g., draft that is conducted in chat without the use of an in-game feature).

### 5.16.2 Restrictions on Gameplay Elements. 
Restrictions may be added at any time before or during a match, if there are known bugs with any items, Champions, skins, runes, masteries, or Summoner spells, or for any other reason as determined at the discretion of the Campus Series.

### 5.16.3 Selection Error
In the event of an erroneously-selected Champion pick or ban, the team in error must notify a Campus Series official before the other team has locked in their next selection. If so, the process will be restarted and brought back to the point at which the error occurred so that the team in error may correct its mistake. If the next selection is locked before the team in error gives notice to a Campus Series official, the erroneous selection shall be deemed irrevocable.

### 5.16.4 Trading Champions
Teams must complete all champion trades before the 20-second mark during the Trading Phase, or will be subject to a penalty in future games.

### 5.16.5 Game Start
A game will start immediately after the pick/ban process is complete, unless otherwise stated by a Campus Series official. Players are not allowed to quit a game during the time between the completion of picks/bans and game launch.

### 5.16.6 Controlled Game Start
In the event of an error in game start or a decision by Campus Series to separate the pick/ban process from game start, a Campus Series official may start the game in a controlled manner using Blind Pick. All players will select Champions in accordance with the previous valid completed Champion Select process.

# 6 Game Rules

## 6.1 Game of Record
A game of record (“GOR”) refers to a game where all ten players have loaded and which has progressed to a point of meaningful interaction between opposing teams. Once a game attains GOR status, the period ends in which incidental restarts may be permitted and a game will be considered as “official” from that point onward. After the establishment of GOR, game restarts will be allowed only under limited conditions (see [Section 6.3](#63-game-restart)).  Examples of conditions which establish GOR:

 - **6.1.1 Hostile contact.**  Any attack or ability is landed on minions, jungle creeps, structures, or enemy Champions.
 - **6.1.2 Vision**.  Vision established between players on opposing teams.
 - **6.1.3 Invasion**.  Setting foot, establishing vision or targeting skillshot ability in opponent’s jungle by either team, which includes either leaving the river or entering brush connected to enemy jungle.
 - **6.1.4 Time**. Game timer reaches two minutes (00:02:00).


## 6.2 Directed Pause.
Campus Series officials may order the pause of a match or execute a pause command at any time for any reason, at their sole discretion.

## 6.3 Game Restart
If a game experiences a critical bug at any point during the match that significantly alters game stats or gameplay mechanics, or the external environmental conditions at a live event become untenable then a restart may occur.

Certain circumstances must be met before a restart may occur. Campus Series officials must determine that the bug is critical and verifiable. For the bug to be considered critical, the bug must significantly damage a player’s ability to compete in the game situation.  The determination of whether the bug has damaged a player’s ability to compete is up to the sole discretion of the Campus Series officials. In order for a bug to be considered verifiable, the bug must be conclusively present and not possibly attributable to player error. The spectator must then be able to replay the instance in question and verify the bug. 

If a player believes s/he has experienced a critical bug, s/he must pause the game and alert a referee in a timely fashion. If it is believed that a player is attempting to delay reporting of a bug to wait for a possible restart at a more advantageous time, then a restart will no longer be granted.

If Campus Series officials determine that the bug is critical and verifiable and that the player followed the pause protocol, then the disadvantaged team will be presented with the option for a restart. If the team accepts, the game will immediately be restarted.  If the restart occurred due to a champion bug, then settings no longer will be retained (including picks and bans) regardless of Game of Record status and the champion will be made ineligible for at least the remainder of the day’s matches unless the bug can be conclusively tied to a specific game element that can be fully removed (i.e. a skin that can be disabled) or prohibited (i.e. the purchase of items).

If a team is offered a restart and declines, then the team will be ineligible to request a restart on the bug that caused the potential restart for the remainder of the match. However, Campus Series officials reserve the right at all times to force a game restart if the game environment reaches a level of instability that compromises the competitive integrity of the game.

This section is applicable if the pause is directed as per [Section 6.2](#62-directed-pause) and does not limit the ability of a Campus Series official to institute a restart.

### 6.3.1 Controlled Environment
Certain conditions may be preserved in the event of a restart of a game that has not reached GOR, including, without limitation, Champion Select, rune/mastery loadouts, or Summoner spells. If, however, a match has reached GOR then Campus Series officials shall not retain any settings.

### 6.3.2 Player Confirmation of Settings
Each team captain shall verify that every player on his/her team has finalized their intended game settings (including runes, masteries, controls, and GUI settings) before GOR is established. Any error in verification is not grounds for a game restart after GOR is established.

## 6.4 Awarded Game Victory
In the event of a technical difficulty which leads Campus Series officials to declare a restart, the Campus Series may instead award a game victory to a team. If a game has been played for more than 20 minutes on the game clock (00:20:00), Campus Series officials, in their sole discretion, may determine that a team cannot avoid defeat to a degree of reasonable certainty. The following criteria may be used in the determination of reasonable certainty.

 - **6.4.1 Gold Differential**. The winning team has more than 133% of the losing team’s gold.
 - **6.4.2 Remaining Turret Differential**. The difference in the number of remaining turrets between the teams is more than seven (7).
 - **6.4.3 Remaining Inhibitor Differential**. The difference in the number of standing inhibitors between the teams is more than two (2).

## 6.5 Mid-Match Break
Teams are entitled to a short break of at least 5 minutes between games of a multi-game (e.g. best-of-3) match.  Campus Series officials will inform players of the remaining amount of time before the next game’s Champion Select phase begins.  Teams are subject to lateness time if they are not ready to begin after the break time ends.

## 6.6 Results of Forfeiture
Matches won by forfeit will be reported by the minimum score it would take for one team to win the match (e.g. 1-0 for best-of-1 matches, 2-0 for best-of-three matches, 3-0 for best-of-five matches).  No other statistics will be recorded for forfeited matches.

# 7. Player Conduct

#### 7.1.1.2 Competitive Integrity
Teams are expected to play at their best at all times within any Campus Series game, and to avoid any behavior inconsistent with the principles of good sportsmanship, honesty, or fair play.

Hacking is defined as any modification of the League of Legends game client by any player, team or person acting on behalf of a player or a team.
